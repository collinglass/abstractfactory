# abstractfactory

Abstract Factory pattern in Go.


##  Use as Reference Only

Since factories are used to make useful things, this package is basically useless other than as a reference for implementing ```Abstract Factory``` pattern in Go.

Maybe in the future I'll turn this into a framework or a skeleton to write abstract factories but for now, use it only as a reference point.

#### Fancy Factory

Used for testing and example code.
